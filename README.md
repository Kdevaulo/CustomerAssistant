The main value of the application lies in the display of clothing items on a virtual mannequin. Such mechanics help to increase perception when searching for clothes, since the vector of influence is aimed at the visual representation of clothing elements. A successful option is the case in which the user associates himself with the mannequin and imagines how the selected clothes would look on him.
